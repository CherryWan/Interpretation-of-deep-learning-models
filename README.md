## About the files
1. PCA_2D: It's for dimensionality reduction to 2-D space, using PCA algorithm.
2. PCA_3D: It's for dimensionality reduction to 3-D space, using PCA algorithm.
3. t-SNE_2D: It's for dimensionality reduction to 2-D space, using t-SNE algorithm.
4. t-SNE_3D: It's for dimensionality reduction to 3-D space, using t-SNE algorithm.
5. Visualizing_first_layer_filters: It's for the visualization of the first layer filters of Alexnet model. Choose one filter and run the codes, the result for this filter will be output. 
6. layer_activation_with_guided_backprop: It's for the visualization of feature patterns in the hidden layers. Choose one layer and one filter, run the codes.
7. gradcam: It's for the visualization of the support regions for diagnostic decision. 
8. Assiting_functions: It's used for loading the model, preprocessing input images, saving result images, and etc.
